Creation of a Python application containing a movie recommendation system and a dashboard on film characteristics for a movie theater

Group Project 2 at Wild Code School (8 weeks)

• Data preparation and analysis with Pandas (imdb and tmdb datasets)
• Object oriented programming in Python to add an additional "season" column to movie characteristics
• Data visualization in Tableau
• Machine Learning (NLP) for a movie recommendation
• Streamlit as interface for the recommendation system

The files data_clean.py and data_clean_fr.py create all the necessary csv files that other codefiles use.
The files starting with tableau_ create all the csv files for the dashboard, the .jpg files are screenshots of the tableau dashboard.
The files data_recommandations_1.ipynb and and data_recommandations_2.ipynb create all the necessary csv files that the recommandation system uses.
recommandation_nlp_1.py creates a (large) numpy array for the NLP recommendation system that can be tested with the file recommandation_nlp_2.py.
